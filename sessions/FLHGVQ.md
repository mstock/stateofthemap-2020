This study explores the following research questions using OpenStreetMap-based mapping approach and healthcare facility survey from one of seven slums being studied in Africa and Asia. What are the differentials of spatial proximity to health care providers in informal settlements like slum? What are some of the lessons learnt from using OpenStreetMap-based mapping approach for slum health research? Preliminary findings suggest that residents can access four categories of healthcare facilities (Clinics/Maternity Centres; Patent Medicine Stores; Traditional/Faith Healers; Eye Health Centre) within a walking distance (under 1km) where Clinics and Maternity Centres are farthest from most residents.
