It is true that men mappers more dominate OpenStreetMap (OSM) mapping than women mappers. Some mapper communities have the number of female mappers than males mappers. For instance in Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team Indonesia (HOT Indonesia), 19 from 30 mappers in HOT Indonesia are female. Moreover, it is a fact that men and women have some behavioural differences and it might affect their working performance, especially in OSM mapping. According to the number of changesets, addition, deletion and modification in OSM mapping that tracked through OSMCha, it can be seen the difference between female and male mappers when they are mapping some objects in OSM. 

OSMCha offers many features for reviewing OSM, one of the features is to review a changeset and mapper details that include the mapper username, the number of changesets that mapper has contributed in OSM. Besides, it has changeset-map for visualising of changeset on OSM and the addition, deletion, and modification can be seen by other OSM users. Thus, through those data, it can be seen how is the difference between females and males when they are contributing data in OSM, also how the quality of OSM map that they create. I believe, those differences can be helpful for creating better data for OSM and invite another female to contribute in OSM.
