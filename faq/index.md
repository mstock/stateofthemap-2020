<h1 id="for-speakers">FOR SPEAKERS AND SESSION HOSTS</h1>

<h2 id="talk-presented">How is my talk presented?</h2>
There will be an introduction session shortly before the conference for all speakers and session hosts. We will use the following workflow during your talk:
10 minutes before the talk the speaker and the session host test their equipment and connectivity with the video team.
The talk takes place in a Jitsi session which will be streamed publicly.
In the first 2-3 minutes the session hosts gives a short introduction about the speaker and the talk.
Then the pre-recorded video is broadcast.
During the broadcasting of the video the audience has the opportunity to ask questions on the Q&A pad of the talk.
After the video the session host and the speaker go through the questions of the talk. We have allocated about 20 minutes for that.


<h2 id="talk-qa">How can I participate it the Question & Answer session of my talk?</h2>
You have to join the Jitsi session of your talk and talk with the session host about the questions from the audience. You can watch all incoming questions in the Q&A pad (hackpad) linked in the detail page of your talk. It is the task of the session host to make a kind of pre-selection of the questions, sorting them and leaving out those that are inappropriate.


<h1 id="for-sponsors">FOR SPONSORS</h1>

<h2 id="booths">How do sponsor booths work?</h2>
Platinum, gold and silver sponsors will have promoted channels on a BigBlueButton server. They can provide a detailed schedule in the wiki
